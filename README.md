# Climate-Evolution
🌍 Climate Change Prediction Model
An interdisciplinary analysis of Earth's climatic systems using data analytics and visualization.

📜 Project Overview
This project explores the complexities of Earth's climatic systems by examining the mechanisms of climate change from a multidisciplinary perspective. It analyzes global risk indices' annual fluctuations by combining historical meteorological observations with advanced data analysis techniques.

Leveraging Tableau, Python, and modern forecasting tools, this work introduces a novel temperature prediction model for Earth over the next century. By integrating heat maps, satellite images, and linear regression analysis, the project aims to improve the accuracy of climate change predictions and minimize uncertainties surrounding environmental changes.

The findings underscore the urgency for collaboration among scientists, engineers, and policymakers to address climate resilience and implement strategies for adaptation in the face of a rapidly changing climate.
